# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Future Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The Future plugin stands-in for a page about to be created. When one links to a non-existant page a temporary (ghost) page is created containing the Future plugin. The Future plugin creates new pages much like the Factory plugin creates new story items.
